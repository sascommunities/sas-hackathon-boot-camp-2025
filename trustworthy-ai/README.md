**Trustworthy AI**

**Objectives:**
The goal of this assignment is to create a comprehensive model card for your machine learning model. A model card provides essential information about the model, including its intended use, performance metrics, ethical considerations, and limitations. 

**Step 1: Register your model, create model card**

**Description:** Register your model created in SAS Model Studio assignment from SAS Model Studio

**Specific Instructions:**

1.Go to Data Tab in SAS Model Studio, to generate bias assessment, mark a variable as “assess for bias” 

2.Register the model in Pipeline Comparison 

3.Navigate to “Manage Models” which will open up SAS Model Manager, click on your registered model and see that the model card is automatically

4.You will see 5 sections in your model card -> Overview, Model Usage, Data Summary, Model Summary and Model Audit

5.You will need to update Model Usage, Data Summary

6.Refer to this article (https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Creating-a-Model-Nutrition-Label-Model-Cards-for-SAS-Model/ta-p/935955) for more visual instructions


**Step 2:** **Update your model card**

**Description:** Update relevant information related to your model in the model card

**Specific Instructions:**

1.Update Model Usage in Model Properties tab

2.For Data Summary, click the Analyze data button, to update the information like description, approvals, tags, you can click the dataset name ad it opens in SAS Information Catalog

3.Create KPI rules in Project Properties

4.Upload performance monitoring data SIM_ADMISSIONPERF_1_Q1.csv

5.In the project performance tab define and run performance monitoring

**Outcome & Technology**

**Expected Outcome:**

Completed Model card which will act as as “nutrition label for your model that supports the development of trustworthy AI systems 

**Technology/Other Resources:** 

1.SAS Information catalog, SAS Model Studio and SAS Model manager
