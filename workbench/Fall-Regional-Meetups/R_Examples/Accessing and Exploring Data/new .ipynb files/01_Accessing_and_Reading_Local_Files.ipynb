       "2 I met my friend at the mall today.  she complimented me on my outfit (i was wearing this jumpsuit in the navy with white polka dots motif - there's also a red, black, and white geometric print if you're not into polka dots).  half way through our time together, she realized that i was wearing a jumpsuit, not a dress.  she said that the legs are so wide and flowy that she couldn't tell.  we tried on clothes at another store and i forgot to re secure the straps with the little snaps to my bra stra\n",
       "3 I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2\" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.                       \n",
       "4 Great fit. i love the slightly cropped leg and the dark, unvariating stain. fits like other pilcros. one caveat...the stain rubs off. i can see it on the edges of my white kitchen countertops. i've washed them twice with mixed clothing, and there weren't any problems with color transfer there. still, i like them so much that i'll buy a second pair if they go on sale, and i'll keep wiping the edges of my counters down!                                                                               \n",
